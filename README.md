# CodeChallenge

This was a coding challenge for a company. In Python, I was asked to write a script that would:
1. Open a CSV file
2. Drop one of the columns in the file
3. Search through the file for a pattern of "e?e" (? meaning whatever or *) and replace it with "a?a".

It was a neat little challenge that taught me more about REGEX and CSV files and their usages with Python.
